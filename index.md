Welcome to the third project in my **Docs‑as‑Code Portfolio Series**, where I’m building and publishing documentation sites using four different static site generators: **MkDocs**, **Hugo**, **Docusaurus**, and **Jekyll**.

This site represents my work with **Jekyll** and demonstrates how I approach modern documentation workflows—from information architecture and content strategy to build automation and publishing.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

As a Sr. Technical Writer, I use git‑based workflows and developer‑centric tooling.  
This portfolio series is my opportunity to:

- Strengthen and demonstrate my docs‑as‑code skills  
- Explore and compare popular SSGs used in engineering teams  
- Showcase real examples of my technical writing  
- Build documentation sites end‑to‑end using best practices  
- Create a curated, public‑facing writing and tooling portfolio  

> **Tip:**  
> This page serves as the documentation homepage in this Jekyll version of the project.  
> Unlike Docusaurus—where placing a file at `docs/index.md` automatically becomes the docs root—  
> in Jekyll you can customize your landing page by choosing to name this file `index.md` instead of `about.md`.

## ⚙️ What I Built Using **Jekyll**

### 🔧 Full Docs‑as‑Code Workflow
- Authored content in Markdown  
- Version control with Git  
- Custom sidebar built using Jekyll collections  
- Light‑only theme to match portfolio preferences  
- Local dev environment using `bundle exec jekyll serve`  

### 🚀 Automated Build & Publish
- Local live preview during authoring  
- Production build via `jekyll build`  
- Deployable via GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions  

### 📚 Organized Documentation Examples
This site includes the same structured documentation sections used in your other SSG projects:

- **User Guides** → `/user-guides/`  
- **API Guides** → `/api-guides/`  
- **How‑To Articles** → `/how-to/`  
- **Technical Reference Guides** → `/reference/`

## 🚧 What’s Next: 4‑SSG Series Roadmap

1. **MkDocs** — ✔️ Completed  
2. **Hugo** — Work in progress  
3. **Docusaurus** — ✔️ Completed  
4. **Jekyll** — ✔️ This site

At the end of the series, I’ll publish a comparative write‑up covering setup, customization, plugin ecosystems, docs‑as‑code workflows, and best use cases.
