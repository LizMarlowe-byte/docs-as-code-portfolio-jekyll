# docs-as-code-portfolio-jekyll
A Jekyll‑based documentation demo designed to showcase my docs‑as‑code approach, Markdown authoring expertise, and ability to configure Ruby‑driven static site generators. This project includes custom collection structures, clean content organization, and a flexible layout foundation suitable for technical documentation.
